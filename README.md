### Employee Tracker

### Motivation

* The motivation for building this application is to allow employers and managers to keep track of their departments, employees, and roles that are held by their employees. Ever since we were able to witness how many employees and roles there are in a large chemical company, we decided that this kind of application would be a great help. There are large companies that have hundreds of employees in a single building and just remembering names is hard enough, let alone remembering names and roles or which department they are located in.

### Features

* This application allows you to add, view, or update employees, roles, and departments for a company. When you start the application it gives you various options of what would you like to do. When you choose add, it allows you to add new employees and input all the important information for each employee. When you press view employee, it allows you to see all the employees in the company in a table. This table shows all the useful information that has been inputed to it before.

### Build Status

* This build is currently far from it's final form. There is a lot of room for improvement in the application and places where there should be a lot more options. The application still has some ways to go before it can be fully implemented into a large scale work environment.

### Future Development

* For future development, we would like to add the ability to modify almost every part of adding employees and showing what department they belong to. We would also like to add the ability to delete employees when they leave the company. We would also like to allow managers and employers to be able to modify the kind of information that they want for each employee. There would also be options to make all the information about each employee or role modifiable.
